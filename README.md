# **Lazorb0i**

Lazorboi is an embedded system that performs a lazer show based on frequency from audio signals.

Currently, there is a functional command-line tool that allows the user to control two motors with digital input.

The materials used in this project include:
* (Onion) Omega Power Dock 2
* (Onion) Omega2
* (SparkFun) Motor Driver - Dual TB6612FNG
* Two 6V DC motors
* Two mirrors
* Power source

## Omega2

The Omega2 is an IoT device that runs its own linux OS. In order to run C/C++ code on the Omega2, it must be compiled for the **mips** architecture.

The documentation for the Omega2 can be found [here](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/).
